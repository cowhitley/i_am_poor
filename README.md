# i_am_poor

A simple flutter project challenge from https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/?couponCode=ACCAGE0923 based on a parody of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich. The objective was to create a simple layout using MaterialApp, Scaffold, Image, AssetImage, and AppBar Widgets and making sure to use custom app logos.
